//! Control-plane infrastructure trust tasks: server registration and health.
//!
//! These are the control↔server ops that used to exist only as legacy `MSG_*`
//! DIDComm messages, which made them DIDComm-only and therefore invisible to a
//! TSP-only server. As trust-task documents they route through the same
//! [`crate::messaging::dispatch_trust_task_doc`] entry that TSP, the DIDComm
//! envelope, and HTTPS all share — so the binding is chosen from the peer's DID
//! document rather than hard-coded.
//!
//! ## One Type URI per op, on every wire
//!
//! The `MSG_*` constants in `didcomm_types` are *already* canonical Trust-Task
//! Type URIs, with the `_ACK` / `_PONG` forms being the `#response` variant of
//! their request:
//!
//! ```text
//! MSG_SERVER_REGISTER      .../spec/did-management/server/register/0.1
//! MSG_SERVER_REGISTER_ACK  .../spec/did-management/server/register/0.1#response
//! MSG_HEALTH_PING          .../spec/did-management/server/health/0.1
//! MSG_HEALTH_PONG          .../spec/did-management/server/health/0.1#response
//! ```
//!
//! So we reuse them verbatim as document Type URIs. The op has one identity
//! whether it travels as a DIDComm `typ`, inside a trust-task envelope, or as a
//! raw TSP frame — and `TrustTask::respond_with` *derives* the reply URI rather
//! than us restating it. `send::msg_constants_are_request_response_type_uri_pairs`
//! pins that.
//!
//! Note the unused `TASK_SERVER_HEALTH_PING_1_0` / `_PONG_1_0` constants in
//! `did_hosting_tasks` are **not** used here: they sit on the `/did-hosting/`
//! authority with no `/spec/` segment, so they don't parse as Type URIs at all,
//! and they wrongly model the response as a separate URI instead of a fragment.
//! They are route-header decorators for the HTTPS surface, nothing more.
//!
//! ## Why this bypasses the §7.2 pipeline
//!
//! Registration authenticates via the ACL (`Service` role) against the
//! transport-proven sender, exactly as the DIDComm route did. Health pong
//! carries no authority at all — it only marks an already-registered instance
//! Active, keyed by sender DID. Neither needs proof verification or audience
//! binding beyond what the transport already guarantees, and running them
//! through `dispatch_inbound` would demand typed payload specs that don't exist
//! upstream. If these ops ever grow authority, move them onto the typed
//! pipeline like `trust_tasks_did`.
