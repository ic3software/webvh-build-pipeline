//! Rotation of the control plane's *own* DID identity.
//!
//! Three entry points, all of which end in the same place — the live set in
//! [`ServiceIdentity`] changes, so the listener's profile has to be rebuilt:
//!
//! - [`on_did_published`] — the trigger. Fires from the publish path on every
//!   publish of a DID, and does real work only when the DID is ours.
//! - [`run_identity_sweep_loop`] — the reaper. Drops generations whose grace
//!   period has elapsed.
//! - [`reload_now`] — the periodic backstop, for identity changes that never
//!   went through our publish path (an out-of-band update, or one applied while
//!   the process was down).
//!
//! The listener is rebuilt in place with `remove_listener` / `add_listener`,
//! which take `&self`. The `DIDCommService` itself is never replaced — only the
//! one listener it holds for our DID — so the `OnceLock` in `AppState` stays
//! sound and no other state has to be re-threaded.
