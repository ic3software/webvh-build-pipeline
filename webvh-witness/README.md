# Affinidi WebVH Witness

The WebVH Witness node generates and manages cryptographic witness
proofs for [WebVH](https://www.w3.org/TR/did-web-vh/) DID integrity
verification. Witness proofs provide third-party attestation that a
DID document was observed at a specific point in time.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Rust 1.94.0+ (2024 Edition)

### 1. Build

```bash
cargo build -p affinidi-webvh-witness --release
```

The binary is produced at `target/release/webvh-witness`.

### 2. Run the setup wizard

```bash
webvh-witness setup                          # interactive
webvh-witness setup --from <recipe.toml>     # non-interactive (CI / scripted)
```

For non-interactive runs see
[docs/bootstrap_startup.md](../docs/bootstrap_startup.md#non-interactive-setup-recipe-driven)
and the example recipe at `examples/webvh-witness-build.toml`.

The interactive wizard walks you through configuration:

- **VTA credential** — authenticates with the witness's VTA
  context and creates the witness DID automatically
- **Features** — enable DIDComm messaging and/or REST API
- **DID hosting** — URL and path where webvh-server will host
  the witness DID
- **Host / port** — listen address (default: `0.0.0.0:8102`)
- **Log level / format** — logging configuration
- **Data directory** — persistent storage path
- **Secrets backend** — where to store private key material
- **Admin bootstrap** — enter an existing DID or generate a
  new `did:key` identity

### 3. Start the witness

```bash
webvh-witness --config config.toml
```

## Configuration

The witness is configured via a TOML file. By default it looks
for `config.toml` in the current directory. You can specify a
different path with the `--config` flag or the
`WITNESS_CONFIG_PATH` environment variable.

### Example `config.toml`

```toml
server_did = "did:webvh:witness.example.com"
mediator_did = "did:webvh:mediator.example.com"

[features]
didcomm = true
rest_api = true

[server]
host = "0.0.0.0"
port = 8531

[log]
level = "info"
format = "text"

[store]
data_dir = "data/webvh-witness"

[auth]
access_token_expiry = 900
refresh_token_expiry = 86400
challenge_ttl = 300

[secrets]
keyring_service = "webvh-witness"

# Optional: VTA integration for remote key management
# [vta]
# url = "https://vta.example.com"
# did = "did:webvh:vta.example.com"
# context_id = "witness-context"
```

### Environment Variable Overrides

Environment variables use the `WITNESS_` prefix:

| Variable                    | Description               |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| `WITNESS_CONFIG_PATH`       | Path to config file       |
| `WITNESS_SERVER_DID`        | Witness DID identifier    |
| `WITNESS_MEDIATOR_DID`      | Mediator DID identifier   |
| `WITNESS_SERVER_HOST`       | Bind host                 |
| `WITNESS_SERVER_PORT`       | Bind port                 |
| `WITNESS_LOG_LEVEL`         | Log level                 |
| `WITNESS_VTA_URL`           | VTA REST URL              |
| `WITNESS_VTA_DID`           | VTA DID                   |
| `WITNESS_VTA_CONTEXT_ID`    | VTA context ID            |

## CLI Commands

```
webvh-witness                                  # Run witness (default)
webvh-witness setup                            # Interactive config wizard
webvh-witness add-acl --did <DID> [--role admin|owner]  # Add ACL entry
webvh-witness list-acl                         # List ACL entries
webvh-witness create-witness [--label <name>]  # Create witness identity
webvh-witness list-witnesses                   # List witness identities
webvh-witness delete-witness --id <ID>         # Delete witness identity
```

### Witness Identity Management

Before the witness can sign proofs, you need to create at least
one witness identity:

```bash
# Create a witness identity
webvh-witness create-witness --label "primary"

# List all witness identities
webvh-witness list-witnesses

# Delete a witness identity
webvh-witness delete-witness --id z6Mk...
```

## API Endpoints

All API endpoints are under the `/api` prefix.

## Library Usage

[webvh-daemon](../webvh-daemon/)). It exposes:

- `affinidi_webvh_witness::config::AppConfig` — configuration
- `affinidi_webvh_witness::server::AppState` — application state
- `affinidi_webvh_witness::routes::router()` — Axum router
- `affinidi_webvh_witness::server::run()` — standalone entry point
- `affinidi_webvh_witness::signing::LocalSigner` — witness proof signing
