/**
 * Service badges — render what a DID document advertises.
 *
 * One mapping, used by the DID list, the Servers list, and the dashboard's
 * control-plane card, so a `TSPTransport` service reads the same everywhere.
 *
 * The badges are derived purely from the `service[].type` values in the DID
 * document (see `did_hosting_common::did::service_types_from_doc`). There is
 * deliberately no "VTA" badge: nothing in the vta-sdk templates or in
 * `build_did_document` emits a VTA service type. "VTA" is a provisioning
 * mode, not a service — the `#vta-didcomm` service *id* has type
 * `DIDCommMessaging` and therefore shows as the DIDComm badge.
 *
 * Anything we don't have a first-class badge for collapses into a single
 * `Other` chip, whose tooltip lists the raw type names.
