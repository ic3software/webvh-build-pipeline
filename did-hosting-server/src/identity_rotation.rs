//! Rotation of the server's *own* DID identity.
//!
//! The mirror of `did_hosting_control::identity_rotation`. Same model, two
//! differences that follow from what a server is:
//!
//! - Its listener id is `server`, not `control`.
//! - Its own DID can change through **two** paths, not one: a direct publish
//!   (`did_ops::publish_did`), or a sync update pushed from a control plane
//!   (`MSG_SYNC_UPDATE` → `apply_single_update`). Both funnel into
//!   [`on_did_published`].
//!
//! In **daemon mode this module is inert**, and deliberately so: the embedded
//! server runs no DIDComm listener of its own (CLAUDE.md — the control plane's
//! listener handles the full protocol on the authoritative store), so its
//! `didcomm_service` slot is never filled and `rebuild_listener` no-ops. The
//! daemon's control plane owns the rotation. Nothing here needs to be
//! conditionally skipped; the no-op falls out.
