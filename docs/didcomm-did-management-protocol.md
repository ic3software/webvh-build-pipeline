# WebVH DIDComm DID Management Protocol

**Version:** 1.0
**Status:** Draft
**Protocol URI Base:** `https://affinidi.com/webvh/1.0/did`

## Overview

This document specifies a DIDComm v2 protocol for the full lifecycle management of `did:webvh` DIDs through a WebVH service. The protocol replaces the REST-based DID management endpoints with end-to-end DIDComm encrypted messaging, ensuring that all communication between the client and the WebVH server is authenticated, integrity-protected, and confidential.

The protocol covers:
- **Creating** a new DID (URI reservation and initial publication)
- **Updating** a DID (publishing new log entries)
- **Uploading witness** proofs for a DID
- **Querying** DID information and statistics
- **Listing** owned DIDs
- **Deleting** a DID

## Prerequisites

- The client MUST have an authenticated session with the WebVH server, obtained via the existing [authentication protocol](../did-hosting-server/README.md) (`https://affinidi.com/webvh/1.0/authenticate`).
- The client MUST possess a `did:key` identity with Ed25519 signing and X25519 key agreement keys.
- The server MUST have a resolvable DID with key agreement capabilities for DIDComm encryption.

## Message Types

### DID Creation & Publication

| Message Type | Direction | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `https://affinidi.com/webvh/1.0/did/request` | Client -> Server | Request a new DID URI reservation. Optional `force` field lets the current owner or an admin re-claim an existing path (see [Force-replace](#force-replace-on-did-request)). |
| `https://affinidi.com/webvh/1.0/did/offer` | Server -> Client | Provide the reserved mnemonic and DID URL |
| `https://affinidi.com/webvh/1.0/did/publish` | Client -> Server | Submit the signed DID log entry for publication |
| `https://affinidi.com/webvh/1.0/did/confirm` | Server -> Client | Confirm successful publication |
| `https://affinidi.com/webvh/1.0/did/register` | Client -> Server | Atomic claim-and-publish — reserves a path AND publishes the first signed log entry in a single round-trip. Closes the resolvability gap of the two-step `did/request` + `did/publish` flow. |
| `https://affinidi.com/webvh/1.0/did/register-confirm` | Server -> Client | Confirm successful atomic registration |

### DID Ownership

| Message Type | Direction | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `https://affinidi.com/webvh/1.0/did/change-owner` | Client -> Server | Transfer ownership of an existing DID to another DID. Requester must be the current owner or an admin; the new owner must already be in the ACL. |
| `https://affinidi.com/webvh/1.0/did/change-owner-confirm` | Server -> Client | Confirm successful ownership transfer |

### Witness Management

| Message Type | Direction | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `https://affinidi.com/webvh/1.0/did/witness-publish` | Client -> Server | Upload a witness proof file for a DID |
| `https://affinidi.com/webvh/1.0/did/witness-confirm` | Server -> Client | Confirm successful witness upload |

### DID Information & Statistics

| Message Type | Direction | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `https://affinidi.com/webvh/1.0/did/info-request` | Client -> Server | Request detailed information about a DID |
| `https://affinidi.com/webvh/1.0/did/info` | Server -> Client | Return DID details, metadata, and statistics |
| `https://affinidi.com/webvh/1.0/did/list-request` | Client -> Server | Request a list of owned DIDs |
| `https://affinidi.com/webvh/1.0/did/list` | Server -> Client | Return the list of DIDs |

### DID Deletion

| Message Type | Direction | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `https://affinidi.com/webvh/1.0/did/delete` | Client -> Server | Request deletion of a DID |
| `https://affinidi.com/webvh/1.0/did/delete-confirm` | Server -> Client | Confirm successful deletion |

### Error Handling

## Message Specifications

All messages are packed as DIDComm v2 signed/encrypted messages (JWE) using the client's Ed25519 signing key and the server's X25519 key agreement key for encryption.

### 1. DID Request

**Type:** `https://affinidi.com/webvh/1.0/did/request`
**Direction:** Client -> Server

The client initiates DID creation by requesting a URI reservation from the server.

**Message Structure:**

```json
{
  "id": "urn:uuid:550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000",
  "type": "https://affinidi.com/webvh/1.0/did/request",
  "from": "did:key:z6MkhaXgBZDvotDkL5257faiztiGiC2QtKLGpbnnEGta2doK",
  "to": ["did:web:webvh.example.com"],
  "created_time": 1700000000,
  "body": {
    "path": "my-custom-name"
  }
}
```

**Body Fields:**

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `path` | string | No | Custom path/mnemonic for the DID. If omitted, the server generates a random mnemonic. Must be URL-safe and not already reserved. |
| `force` | bool | No | When `true` and `path` is taken, replace the existing slot. The caller must be an admin or the current owner of that path; otherwise the server replies with `e.p.did.unauthorized`. The old log content, witness, and owner-index entry are wiped; the caller becomes the new owner. Defaults to `false` (existing-path collisions return `e.p.did.path-unavailable`). See [Force-replace](#force-replace-on-did-request). |

**Server Processing:**

1. Verify the sender's DID is in the ACL.
2. Check the sender's DID count quota (admins are exempt).
3. If `path` is provided, validate it is URL-safe.
4. If `path` is provided and the path exists:
   - if `force` is `false` → respond `e.p.did.path-unavailable`.
   - if `force` is `true` and the caller is admin-or-current-owner → wipe old content/witness/owner-index, then proceed.
   - otherwise → respond `e.p.did.unauthorized`.
5. If `path` is omitted, generate a random mnemonic.
6. Create a `DidRecord` with owner, mnemonic, and timestamps.
7. Store the record and owner index atomically.
8. Respond with `did/offer` or `did/problem-report`.

#### Force-replace on DID Request

`force=true` lets an admin or the current owner of an existing path
re-claim it. After the wipe, the path's `did/offer` reservation is
fresh — *no log content has been published yet*. Downstream
resolvers retain their previous copy of the DID document until the
caller follows up with `did/publish`. If you need an atomic
ownership-takeover with no resolvability gap, use [`did/register`](#3-did-register)
instead — it claims and publishes in a single message and triggers a
single fan-out to downstream servers.

### 2. DID Offer

**Type:** `https://affinidi.com/webvh/1.0/did/offer`
**Direction:** Server -> Client

The server responds with the reserved mnemonic and the URL where the DID will be resolvable.

**Message Structure:**

```json
{
  "id": "urn:uuid:6ba7b810-9dad-11d1-80b4-00c04fd430c8",
  "type": "https://affinidi.com/webvh/1.0/did/offer",
  "from": "did:web:webvh.example.com",
  "to": ["did:key:z6MkhaXgBZDvotDkL5257faiztiGiC2QtKLGpbnnEGta2doK"],
  "created_time": 1700000001,
  "thid": "urn:uuid:550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000",
  "body": {
    "mnemonic": "apple-banana",
    "did_url": "https://webvh.example.com/apple-banana/did.jsonl",
    "server_did": "did:web:webvh.example.com"
  }
}
```

**Body Fields:**

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `mnemonic` | string | Yes | The reserved mnemonic/path for the DID. Used as identifier in subsequent messages. |
| `did_url` | string | Yes | The URL where the DID document will be resolvable after publication. |
| `server_did` | string | Yes | The server's DID, used by the client to construct the DID document with the correct host. |

**Notes:**

- The `thid` (thread ID) MUST reference the `id` of the originating `did/request` message to correlate request and response.
- The client uses `did_url` to derive the host component for DID document construction.

### 3. DID Publish

**Type:** `https://affinidi.com/webvh/1.0/did/publish`
**Direction:** Client -> Server

Used for both initial publication and subsequent updates. The client submits the complete signed WebVH log for the DID.

For initial creation, this follows a `did/request` -> `did/offer` exchange. For updates, the client sends `did/publish` directly using the known mnemonic.

**Message Structure:**

```json
{
  "id": "urn:uuid:7c9e6679-7425-40de-944b-e07fc1f90ae7",
  "type": "https://affinidi.com/webvh/1.0/did/publish",
  "from": "did:key:z6MkhaXgBZDvotDkL5257faiztiGiC2QtKLGpbnnEGta2doK",
  "to": ["did:web:webvh.example.com"],
  "created_time": 1700000010,
  "thid": "urn:uuid:550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000",
  "body": {
    "mnemonic": "apple-banana",
    "did_log": "{\"versionId\":\"1-QmHash...\",\"versionTime\":\"2025-01-23T04:12:36Z\",\"parameters\":{\"method\":\"did:webvh:1.0\",\"scid\":\"QmSCID...\",\"updateKeys\":[\"z82Lk...\"],\"portable\":false},\"state\":{\"@context\":[\"https://www.w3.org/ns/did/v1\"],\"id\":\"did:webvh:QmSCID:webvh.example.com:apple-banana\",\"authentication\":[\"did:webvh:QmSCID:webvh.example.com:apple-banana#key-0\"],\"assertionMethod\":[\"did:webvh:QmSCID:webvh.example.com:apple-banana#key-0\"],\"verificationMethod\":[{\"id\":\"did:webvh:QmSCID:webvh.example.com:apple-banana#key-0\",\"type\":\"Multikey\",\"controller\":\"did:webvh:QmSCID:webvh.example.com:apple-banana\",\"publicKeyMultibase\":\"z6Mk...\"}]},\"proof\":[{\"type\":\"DataIntegrityProof\",\"cryptosuite\":\"eddsa-jcs-2022\",\"verificationMethod\":\"did:webvh:QmSCID:webvh.example.com:apple-banana#key-0\",\"proofPurpose\":\"authentication\",\"proofValue\":\"z...\"}]}"
  }
}
```

**Body Fields:**

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `mnemonic` | string | Yes | The mnemonic returned in the `did/offer` message (or previously known for updates). |
| `did_log` | string | Yes | The complete WebVH DID log as a JSONL string. Each line is a signed log entry. For initial creation this is a single line. For updates this contains the full log chain. |

**Server Processing:**

1. Verify the sender owns the DID record associated with the mnemonic.
2. Parse and validate each line of the JSONL log.
3. Verify all Data Integrity Proofs in the log entries.
4. Check total content size against the owner's quota.
5. Extract the `did:webvh` identifier from the last log entry's `state.id`.
6. Store the JSONL content atomically with the updated DID record.
7. Increment version count and update statistics.
8. Respond with `did/confirm` or `did/problem-report`.

### 4. DID Confirm

**Type:** `https://affinidi.com/webvh/1.0/did/confirm`
**Direction:** Server -> Client

The server confirms that the DID log has been successfully stored and the DID is resolvable.

**Message Structure:**

```json
{
  "id": "urn:uuid:8a3b4c5d-6e7f-8901-2345-678901234567",
  "type": "https://affinidi.com/webvh/1.0/did/confirm",
  "from": "did:web:webvh.example.com",
  "to": ["did:key:z6MkhaXgBZDvotDkL5257faiztiGiC2QtKLGpbnnEGta2doK"],
  "created_time": 1700000011,

    "version_id": "1-QmHash...",
    "version_count": 1
  }
}
```

**Body Fields:**

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `did_id` | string | Yes | The fully resolved `did:webvh` identifier including the SCID. |
| `did_url` | string | Yes | The URL where the DID document can be resolved. |
| `version_id` | string | Yes | The version identifier of the latest published log entry. |
| `version_count` | integer | Yes | Total number of versions for this DID. |

---

### 14. DID Register

**Type:** `https://affinidi.com/webvh/1.0/did/register`
**Direction:** Client -> Server

Atomic claim-and-publish — reserves a path AND publishes the first
signed log entry in a single round-trip. Equivalent to `did/request`
+ `did/publish` but with no resolvability gap between path
reservation and first publish.

Use this when a client already has the signed log entry ready (the
common case for tooling that builds the log locally from a
known-good identity) and wants the slot's content visible to
downstream resolvers as soon as the registration confirms.

**Message Structure:**

```json
{
  "id": "urn:uuid:1c2b3a4d-5e6f-7081-92a3-b4c5d6e7f809",
  "type": "https://affinidi.com/webvh/1.0/did/register",
  "from": "did:key:z6MkhaXgBZDvotDkL5257faiztiGiC2QtKLGpbnnEGta2doK",
  "to": ["did:web:webvh.example.com"],
  "created_time": 1700000010,
  "body": {
    "path": "tenant/alice",
    "did_log": "{\"versionId\":\"1-Qm…\",\"versionTime\":\"…\",\"parameters\":{…},\"state\":{\"id\":\"did:webvh:scid:host:tenant:alice\",…},\"proof\":[…]}",
    "force": false
  }
}
```

**Body Fields:**

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `path` | string | Yes | Custom path/mnemonic for the DID. Must be URL-safe and pass `validate_custom_path`. |
| `did_log` | string | Yes | The signed JSONL DID log (one entry minimum). The latest entry's `state.id` MUST encode the same `(host, path)` the server hosts; mismatched DIDs are rejected with `e.p.did.path-invalid`. |
| `force` | bool | No | Same semantics as `did/request`'s `force`: when `true` and the path is owned by someone else, requires admin role to take over; the slot's prior log/witness/owner-index are wiped before the new content lands. Defaults to `false`. |

**Server Processing:**

1. Verify the sender's DID is in the ACL.
2. Validate `path` and structural shape of `did_log`.
3. Verify the `did_log`'s latest `state.id` matches `(host, path)`.
4. If the slot exists and is owned by the same DID → idempotent re-publish: bump `version_count`, replace content.
5. If the slot exists and is owned by a different DID → require `auth.role == Admin && force == true`; otherwise reply `e.p.did.unauthorized`.
6. Single-batch atomic write: `DidRecord`, log content, owner index (plus old-owner cleanup on takeover).
7. Fan out the new content to downstream servers via `did/sync-update`.
8. Respond with `did/register-confirm` or `did/problem-report`.

### 15. DID Register Confirm

**Type:** `https://affinidi.com/webvh/1.0/did/register-confirm`
**Direction:** Server -> Client

**Message Structure:**

```json
{
  "id": "urn:uuid:2d3c4b5a-6f70-8192-a3b4-c5d6e7f80910",
  "type": "https://affinidi.com/webvh/1.0/did/register-confirm",
  "from": "did:web:webvh.example.com",
  "to": ["did:key:z6MkhaXgBZDvotDkL5257faiztiGiC2QtKLGpbnnEGta2doK"],
  "created_time": 1700000011,
  "thid": "urn:uuid:1c2b3a4d-5e6f-7081-92a3-b4c5d6e7f809",
  "body": {
    "mnemonic": "tenant/alice",
    "did_url": "https://webvh.example.com/tenant/alice/did.jsonl"
  }
}
```

**Body Fields:**

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `mnemonic` | string | Yes | The reserved path (echoes the request's `path`). |
| `did_url` | string | Yes | The HTTPS URL where the DID is now resolvable. |

### 16. DID Change Owner

**Type:** `https://affinidi.com/webvh/1.0/did/change-owner`
**Direction:** Client -> Server

Transfer ownership of an existing DID to a different DID. Use cases:
re-keying an organisation, decommissioning an old controller,
admin-driven re-assignment.

**Message Structure:**

```json
{
  "id": "urn:uuid:3e4d5c6b-7a89-90b1-c2d3-e4f50617f829",
  "type": "https://affinidi.com/webvh/1.0/did/change-owner",
  "from": "did:key:z6MkhaXgBZDvotDkL5257faiztiGiC2QtKLGpbnnEGta2doK",
  "to": ["did:web:webvh.example.com"],
  "created_time": 1700000020,
  "body": {
    "mnemonic": "tenant/alice",
    "new_owner": "did:key:z6Mk…NewOwnerDid"
  }
}
```

**Body Fields:**

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `mnemonic` | string | Yes | The DID slot being transferred. |
| `new_owner` | string | Yes | The DID receiving ownership. Must be in the ACL. Validated via `validate_did_format` (trim, `did:` prefix, no control chars, ≤ 2048 bytes). |

**Server Processing:**

1. Authorize the sender against the existing record's owner (must be the current owner, or have `Admin` role).
2. Validate `new_owner`'s format.
3. If `new_owner == current_owner`: no-op, return success.
4. Verify `new_owner` is in the ACL — otherwise reject with `e.p.did.validation-error` (transferring to an identity that can never authenticate would lose the slot).
5. Atomic batch write: update `DidRecord.owner` and `updated_at`; remove `owner:{prev}:{mnemonic}` index entry; insert `owner:{new}:{mnemonic}` index entry.
6. Respond with `did/change-owner-confirm` or `did/problem-report`.

Authorization order is deliberate: caller-authorization runs *before* `new_owner` format validation so a cross-owner attacker submitting a malformed `new_owner` gets `e.p.did.unauthorized` (correct error class), not `e.p.did.validation-error`.

### 17. DID Change Owner Confirm

## Transport

All protocol messages are transported as DIDComm v2 JWE (JSON Web Encryption) messages over HTTPS.

**Endpoint:** `POST /api/didcomm`

The server determines the protocol and message type by unpacking the DIDComm envelope and inspecting the `type` field. A single transport endpoint handles all DIDComm protocols (authentication, DID management, and any future protocols).

**Request:**
- **Content-Type:** `application/didcomm-encrypted+json`
- **Authorization:** `Bearer <access_token>` (required for all DID management messages)
- **Body:** DIDComm v2 JWE packed message

**Response:**
- **Content-Type:** `application/didcomm-encrypted+json`
- **Body:** DIDComm v2 JWE packed response message

## Security Considerations

1. **End-to-End Encryption:** All messages are DIDComm v2 JWE encrypted, providing confidentiality even over TLS-terminated proxies.
2. **Authentication:** The Bearer token ties each message to an authenticated session. The DIDComm `from` field is verified against the session's DID.
3. **Integrity:** Messages are signed with the sender's Ed25519 key before encryption, preventing tampering.
4. **Replay Protection:** Each message has a unique `id` and `created_time`. The server SHOULD reject messages with timestamps outside an acceptable window.
5. **Authorization:** The server verifies ACL permissions and quota limits before processing any DID operation. Ownership checks ensure users can only manage their own DIDs (admins may manage any DID).
6. **SCID Binding:** The Self-Certifying Identifier (SCID) in the `did:webvh` identifier is derived from the initial log entry, cryptographically binding the DID to its creation parameters.
7. **Atomic Deletion:** DID deletion removes all associated data (record, log, witness, index, stats) in a single atomic batch operation, preventing orphaned data.

## Relationship to Existing REST Endpoints

This DIDComm protocol provides equivalent functionality to the following REST endpoints:

| REST Endpoint | Method | DIDComm Equivalent |
|---|---|---|
| `/api/dids` | POST | `did/request` -> `did/offer` |
| `/api/dids/{mnemonic}` | PUT | `did/publish` -> `did/confirm` |
| `/api/witness/{mnemonic}` | PUT | `did/witness-publish` -> `did/witness-confirm` |
| `/api/dids/{mnemonic}` | GET | `did/info-request` -> `did/info` |
| `/api/stats/{mnemonic}` | GET | (combined into `did/info`) |
| `/api/dids` | GET | `did/list-request` -> `did/list` |
| `/api/dids/{mnemonic}` | DELETE | `did/delete` -> `did/delete-confirm` |

The REST endpoints MAY continue to operate alongside the DIDComm protocol for backward compatibility.
