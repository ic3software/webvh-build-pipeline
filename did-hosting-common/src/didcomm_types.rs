//! Shared DIDComm message type constants for the WebVH protocol.
//!
//! Used by the control plane (VTA provisioning + sync push) and server
//! (sync reception only) to ensure consistent protocol URIs.
//!
//! ## Phase 3 end-state — canonical spec URIs only
//!
//! Every `MSG_*` constant in this module now points at the canonical
//! Trust-Task spec URI under
//! `https://trusttasks.org/spec/{did-management,webvh,auth}/...`
//! per dtgwg-trust-tasks-tf. The legacy `affinidi.com/webvh/1.0/*`
//! URIs and the bidirectional `v1_aliases` translation table were
//! removed in this release — did-hosting accepts spec URIs only.
//!
//! Names retained for source-stability (the dispatcher's `match`
//! arms reference them by identifier), but the value of e.g.
//! `MSG_DID_REQUEST` is now the canonical `spec/did-management/did/
//! check-name/0.1` URI, and `MSG_DID_OFFER` is the matching
//! `…#response` form. The historical pair-URL convention (request +
//! `*-confirm` / `*-offer` / `*-ack` response) collapses to the
//! framework `<type>#response` convention (SPEC §4.4.1).
//!
//! `MSG_DOMAIN_UPSERT` + `MSG_DOMAIN_UPSERT_ACK` stay on the legacy
//! `affinidi.com/...` namespace because they're control-plane
//! → server internal traffic with no Trust-Task spec covering them.
//! All other constants are canonical.
