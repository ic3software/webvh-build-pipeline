# Affinidi WebVH Control Plane

The WebVH Control Plane is the authoritative source of truth for
all DID management. It handles DID lifecycle operations (create,
publish, delete) via DIDComm and optional REST API, and pushes
updates to server edge nodes via DIDComm through a mediator.
It also hosts an optional web-based management UI, maintains a
service registry, acts as a reverse proxy to backend service
instances, and supports DIDComm v2 and passkey (WebAuthn)
authentication.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Rust 1.94.0+ (2024 Edition)
- Node.js 20+ (only if building with the management UI)

### 1. Build

```bash
# Without UI
cargo build -p affinidi-webvh-control --release

# With embedded management UI
cd webvh-ui && npm install && npm run build:web && cd ..
cargo build -p affinidi-webvh-control --release --features ui
```

The binary is produced at `target/release/webvh-control`.

### 2. Run the setup wizard

```bash
webvh-control setup
```

The wizard configures:

- **Configuration file path** — where to write `config.toml`
- **Server DID identity** — for DIDComm authentication
- **Public URL** — for passkey (WebAuthn) RP origin
- **Host / port** — listen address (default: `0.0.0.0:8532`)
- **Log level / format** — logging configuration
- **Data directory** — persistent storage path
- **Secrets backend** — where to store private key material
- **Admin bootstrap** — create an initial admin ACL entry

### 3. Start the control plane

```bash
webvh-control --config config.toml
```

If built with `--features ui`, browse to
`http://localhost:8532/` to access the management UI.

## Configuration

The control plane is configured via a TOML file. By default it
looks for `config.toml` in the current directory. You can specify
a different path with the `--config` flag or the
`CONTROL_CONFIG_PATH` environment variable.

### Example `config.toml`

```toml
server_did = "did:webvh:control.example.com"
mediator_did = "did:webvh:mediator.example.com"
public_url = "https://control.example.com"

[features]
rest_api = true

[server]
host = "0.0.0.0"
port = 8532

[log]
level = "info"

[store]
data_dir = "data/webvh-control"

[auth]
access_token_expiry = 900
refresh_token_expiry = 86400
challenge_ttl = 300
passkey_enrollment_ttl = 86400

[secrets]
keyring_service = "webvh-control"

# Service registry — register backend instances
# [[registry.instances]]
# label = "Primary Server"
# service_type = "server"
# url = "http://localhost:8530"
#
# [[registry.instances]]
# label = "Witness"
# service_type = "witness"
# url = "http://localhost:8531"

[registry]
health_check_interval = 60    # seconds
```

### Service Registry

The `[registry]` section configures backend service instances
that the control plane manages and proxies requests to.

Static instances can be defined in `config.toml`:

```toml
[[registry.instances]]
label = "Primary Server"
service_type = "server"         # server, witness, or watcher
url = "http://localhost:8530"

[[registry.instances]]
label = "Witness Node"
service_type = "witness"
url = "http://localhost:8531"

[[registry.instances]]
label = "EU Watcher"
service_type = "watcher"
url = "http://watcher-eu:8533"
```

Instances can also be managed dynamically via the registry API.

### Environment Variable Overrides

Environment variables use the `CONTROL_` prefix:

| Variable                                   | Description                  |
| ------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------- |
| `CONTROL_CONFIG_PATH`                      | Path to config file          |
| `CONTROL_SERVER_DID`                       | Control plane DID            |
| `CONTROL_MEDIATOR_DID`                     | Mediator DID                 |
| `CONTROL_PUBLIC_URL`                       | Public URL (passkey origin)  |
| `CONTROL_SERVER_HOST`                      | Bind host                    |
| `CONTROL_SERVER_PORT`                      | Bind port                    |
| `CONTROL_LOG_LEVEL`                        | Log level                    |
| `CONTROL_REGISTRY_HEALTH_CHECK_INTERVAL`   | Health check interval (sec)  |

## CLI Commands

```
webvh-control                                    # Run control plane (default)
webvh-control setup                              # Interactive config wizard
webvh-control add-acl --did <DID> [--role admin|owner] [--label <name>]  # Add ACL entry
webvh-control list-acl                           # List ACL entries
```

## Features

### Management UI

When built with the `ui` feature, the control plane embeds a
web-based management interface using `rust-embed`. The UI is
served as a fallback for any non-API GET requests — no separate
web server needed.

The UI provides:

- Server health and DID counts
- DID creation, upload, and deletion
- Witness proof management
- Access control management (admin only)
- Service instance overview

### Passkey Authentication

When built with the `passkey` feature and a `public_url` is
configured, the control plane supports WebAuthn passkey
enrollment and login. This provides browser-based passwordless
authentication alongside DIDComm challenge-response auth.

### Reverse Proxy

The control plane proxies requests to registered backend
service instances. This allows the UI to communicate with
all services through a single origin (no CORS issues):

```
UI → /api/server/{instance_id}/dids → webvh-server
UI → /api/witness/{instance_id}/witnesses → webvh-witness
```

### Health Checking

Registered service instances are periodically health-checked.
The health check interval is configurable via
`registry.health_check_interval` (default: 60 seconds).

## API Endpoints

All API endpoints are under the `/api` prefix.

## Library Usage

The webvh-control crate can be used as a library (e.g., by the
[webvh-daemon](../webvh-daemon/)). It exposes:

- `affinidi_webvh_control::config::AppConfig` — configuration
- `affinidi_webvh_control::server::AppState` — application state
- `affinidi_webvh_control::routes::router()` — Axum router
- `affinidi_webvh_control::server::run()` — standalone entry point
