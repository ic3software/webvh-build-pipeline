# Affinidi WebVH Daemon

The WebVH Daemon is a unified binary that embeds all four WebVH
services — [server](../webvh-server/),
[witness](../webvh-witness/), [watcher](../webvh-watcher/), and
[control plane](../webvh-control/) — behind a single TCP listener.
This is the easiest way to get started with a complete WebVH
deployment.

Each service is mounted at a path prefix:

| Service | Path prefix | Description |
| ------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| Server  | `/`         | Public DID hosting and resolution |
| Witness | `/witness`  | Witness proof signing |
| Watcher | `/watcher`  | Read-only DID mirror |
| Control | `/`         | DID management (DIDComm + REST API), management UI |

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Rust 1.94.0+ (2024 Edition)
- Node.js 20+ (only if building with the management UI)

### 1. Build

```bash
# Without UI
cargo build -p affinidi-webvh-daemon --release

# With embedded management UI
cd webvh-ui && npm install && npm run build:web && cd ..
cargo build -p affinidi-webvh-daemon --release --features ui
```

The binary is produced at `target/release/webvh-daemon`.

### 2. Configure

The fastest way to produce a working `config.toml` is to run
`webvh-daemon setup`, which prompts for the values below and emits a
file you can hand-edit later. A worked example follows for reference:

```toml
server_did = "did:webvh:example.com"
mediator_did = "did:webvh:mediator.example.com"
public_url = "https://example.com"

# Identity mode. Default: "vta". Set to "self-managed" to skip the
# VTA round-trip and have the daemon self-host its own did:webvh
# identifier. See docs/self-managed-mode-spec.md for the trade-offs.
[identity]
mode = "vta"

[server]
host = "0.0.0.0"
port = 8534

[log]
level = "info"

[auth]
access_token_expiry = 900
refresh_token_expiry = 86400

# Secret backend. Pick one — features are mutually exclusive at compile
# time. The daemon's default features include `keyring`; cloud secret
# backends require recompiling with `--features aws-secrets|gcp-secrets|
# azure-secrets` and a corresponding [secrets.<backend>] section.
[secrets]
keyring_service = "webvh-daemon"

# Main store (server, watcher, control share this)
[store]
data_dir = "data/daemon/store"

# Witness store (separate to avoid keyspace collisions)
[witness_store]
data_dir = "data/daemon/witness"

# Which services to enable (all default to true except watcher)
[enable]
server = true
witness = true
watcher = false
control = true
```

For self-managed mode (no VTA), set `[identity] mode = "self-managed"`
and omit the `[vta]` section entirely. The daemon will mint its own
Ed25519 + X25519 keys at first run, host its own `did:webvh`
identifier on `public_url`, and seed an empty ACL — admin enrolment is
done through `webvh-daemon invite --did <DID> --role admin` and the
passkey enrolment flow. See [docs/self-managed-mode-spec.md](../docs/self-managed-mode-spec.md)
for the full walkthrough.

### 3. Start the daemon

```bash
webvh-daemon --config config.toml
```

The daemon starts all enabled services on a single port and logs which
services are active. The control plane and `webvh-server` (public DID
resolver) both merge at root; `webvh-witness` and `webvh-watcher` nest
under their own prefixes:

```
--- daemon services ---
  server (/)
  witness (/witness)
  control (/)
daemon listening on 0.0.0.0:8534
```

## Configuration

The daemon is configured via a TOML file. By default it looks
for `config.toml` in the current directory. You can specify a
different path with the `--config` flag or the
`DAEMON_CONFIG_PATH` environment variable.

### Shared vs Per-Service Settings

Settings like `server_did`, `mediator_did`, `public_url`,
`[auth]`, `[secrets]`, and `[log]` are shared across all
services. Each service gets its own store directory to avoid
keyspace name collisions (both server and witness use `sessions`
and `acl` keyspaces).

### Service-Specific Settings

| Section          | Service | Description |
| ---------------- | ------- | ----------- |
| `[limits]`       | Server  | Upload body limit, per-account quotas |
| `[[watchers]]`   | Server  | Watcher push endpoints |
| `[vta]`          | Witness | VTA remote key management |
| `[watcher_sync]` | Watcher | Push tokens and source servers |
| `[registry]`     | Control | Service instance registry |

### Enable/Disable Services

The `[enable]` section controls which services start:

```toml
[enable]
server = true    # DID hosting (default: true)
witness = true   # Witness proofs (default: true)
watcher = false  # DID mirror (default: false)
control = true   # Management UI (default: true)
```

### Environment Variable Overrides

Environment variables use the `DAEMON_` prefix:

| Variable              | Description             |
| --------------------- | ----------------------- |
| `DAEMON_CONFIG_PATH`  | Path to config file     |
| `DAEMON_SERVER_DID`   | Server DID identifier   |
| `DAEMON_MEDIATOR_DID` | Mediator DID identifier |
| `DAEMON_PUBLIC_URL`   | Public URL              |
| `DAEMON_SERVER_HOST`  | Bind host               |
| `DAEMON_SERVER_PORT`  | Bind port               |
| `DAEMON_LOG_LEVEL`    | Log level               |

## CLI Commands

webvh-daemon                      # Run daemon (default)
webvh-daemon setup                # Interactive config wizard

webvh-daemon restore              # Restore data from backup file
```

## API Path Mapping

When all services are enabled, the daemon exposes endpoints
at the following paths. `webvh-server` (the public-DID-resolver edge
node) and `webvh-control` (the management API + UI) both merge at
root — the daemon is a unified front door rather than a multiplexer.
Witness and watcher are nested under their own prefixes because their
APIs are operator-facing and benefit from a clean URL boundary.

### Server + Control plane (root, merged)

| Path | Description | Source |
| ---- | ----------- | ------ |
| `/api/health` | Combined health endpoint | server / control |
| `/api/auth/*` | DIDComm auth + passkey auth | control plane |
| `/api/dids/*` | DID lifecycle management | control plane |
| `/api/acl/*` | ACL management | control plane |
| `/api/server/{instance_id}/*` | Reverse proxy to a registered server | control plane |
| `/api/witness/{instance_id}/*` | Reverse proxy to a registered witness | control plane |
| `/api/control/registry/*` | Service registry CRUD | control plane |
| `/api/control/stats` | Service-role stats sync ingest | control plane |
| `/{mnemonic}/did.jsonl` | Public DID resolution | server |
| `/.well-known/did.jsonl` | Service-DID resolution | server |
| `/`, `/assets/*` | Management UI (when `ui` feature enabled) | control plane |

### Witness (nested at `/witness`)

| Path | Description |
| ---- | ----------- |
| `/witness/api/health` | Witness health |
| `/witness/api/auth/*` | Witness authentication |
| `/witness/api/witnesses/*` | Witness management |
| `/witness/api/proof/*` | Proof signing |

### Watcher (nested at `/watcher`)

| Path | Description |
| ---- | ----------- |
| `/watcher/api/health` | Watcher health |
| `/watcher/api/sync/*` | Server → watcher sync endpoints |
| `/watcher/{mnemonic}/did.jsonl` | Mirrored public DID resolution |

### Daemon

| Path | Description |
| ---- | ----------- |
| `/health` | Daemon-level health |

## Graceful Shutdown

The daemon handles `SIGINT` (Ctrl+C) and `SIGTERM` for graceful
shutdown. On shutdown, all service stores are persisted before
the process exits.

## Feature Flags

Features propagate to the underlying service crates:

| Feature | Description |
| ------- | ----------- |
| `ui` | Embed the management UI in webvh-control |
| `passkey` | Enable WebAuthn passkey auth in webvh-control |
| `keyring` | OS keyring secrets backend |
| `store-fjall` | Fjall embedded storage backend |

Default features: `keyring`, `store-fjall`, `ui`, `passkey`.
