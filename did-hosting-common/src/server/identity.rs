//! The service's own DID identity, and the generations of key material it
//! still honours.
//!
//! # Why generations
//!
//! When the service's own DID is updated — keys rotated, a service added or
//! removed — peers do not find out at once. A peer that resolved our DID five
//! minutes ago keeps encrypting to the *old* key-agreement key until its cache
//! expires. Cut over instantly and those messages become undecryptable.
//!
//! So an identity is not a single set of keys but a short list of
//! *generations*: the current one, plus any that have been retired but whose
//! grace period has not yet elapsed. Every live generation's key-agreement
//! secret stays loaded, so a message encrypted to any of them still decrypts.
//!
//! This works because **inbound decryption is kid-driven, not
//! document-driven**: the unpack path reads the `kid` off each JWE recipient
//! header and looks it up in the secrets resolver, never consulting our own DID
//! document (`affinidi-messaging-sdk`, `messages/unpack.rs`). Holding an old
//! secret is sufficient; keeping the old verification method *published* is not
//! required. Outbound needs no equivalent handling — it does not sign at all,
//! and its key-agreement key is chosen from our freshly-resolved document, so
//! it moves to the new key on its own.
//!
//! # Why this is persisted
//!
//! `config.toml` only ever describes the *current* identity. After a rotation
//! it holds the new keys and the new mediator; the retiring generation's kids,
//! mediator and expiry exist nowhere else. A restart mid-window would otherwise
//! come back unable to decrypt traffic still addressed to the old key. Hence
//! [`KS_IDENTITY`]: metadata lives in the store, and the private key material
//! stays in the secret store behind the keyring/KMS boundary.
//!
//! Phase 1 establishes the model and persists generation 0. Retirement, the
//! rotation trigger and the expiry sweep land on top of it.
