# Affinidi WebVH Common

Shared library used by all WebVH service crates. This crate
provides common types, traits, and modules so that services
share a consistent implementation of cross-cutting concerns.

> **IMPORTANT:**
> affinidi-webvh-service crates are provided "as is" without any
> warranties or guarantees, and by using this framework, users
> agree to assume all risks associated with its deployment and
> use including implementing security, and privacy measures in

## Modules

### Core Types (`types.rs`)

- `SyncDidRequest` / `SyncDeleteRequest` — DID replication
  payloads used between webvh-server and webvh-watcher

### Server Modules (`server/`, behind `server-core` feature)

Shared infrastructure for authenticated services:

- **`config`** — `ServerConfig`, `LogConfig`, `AuthConfig`,
  `SecretsConfig`, `StoreConfig`, `FeaturesConfig`, and
  `apply_env_overrides()` helper
- **`auth`** — DIDComm v2 challenge-response authentication
  with JWT token issuance. Includes `AuthState` trait,
  `JwtKeys`, session management, and auth extractors
- **`acl`** — Access control with `AclEntry`, `Role`
  (Admin/Owner), and CRUD operations on the ACL keyspace
- **`store`** — Storage abstraction over fjall with
  `KeyspaceHandle`, batch operations, and persistence
- **`secret_store`** — Pluggable secrets backend trait with
  implementations for OS keyring, plaintext (dev only),
  AWS Secrets Manager, and GCP Secret Manager
- **`error`** — `AppError` enum with Axum `IntoResponse`
  implementation
- **`passkey`** — WebAuthn passkey enrollment and login
  (behind `passkey` feature). Provides `PasskeyState` trait
  and generic route handlers

### Witness Client (`witness_client.rs`)

HTTP client for communicating with webvh-witness instances.

## Feature Flags

| Feature | Default | Description |
| ------- | ------- | ----------- |
| `server-core` | off | Server infrastructure (auth, ACL, config, secret-store framework, security headers). Enables every other server-side feature below. |
| `metrics` | off | Prometheus metrics emitters (requires `server-core`). |
| `setup-wizard` | off | Interactive `dialoguer` prompts used by binary setup commands (requires `server-core`). |
| `passkey` | off | WebAuthn passkey enrolment + login (requires `server-core`). |
| `store-fjall` | off | Fjall embedded key-value store. |
| `store-redis` | off | Redis store backend. |
| `store-dynamodb` | off | AWS DynamoDB store backend. |
| `store-firestore` | off | Google Cloud Firestore store backend. |
| `store-cosmosdb` | off | Azure Cosmos DB (`key_auth`) store backend. |
| `keyring` | off | OS keyring secret backend (`keyring-core` 1.x). Supported targets: macOS, Windows, Linux. |
| `aws-secrets` | off | AWS Secrets Manager secret backend. |
| `gcp-secrets` | off | GCP Secret Manager secret backend. |
| `azure-secrets` | off | Azure Key Vault secret backend. |

> **Storage backends are mutually exclusive.** Only one of `store-fjall`,
> `store-redis`, `store-dynamodb`, `store-firestore`, `store-cosmosdb`
> may be active at a time — the binaries' `build.rs` panics at compile
> time if more than one is selected.

## Usage

Services depend on webvh-common with the features they need:

```toml
[dependencies]
affinidi-webvh-common = { path = "../webvh-common", features = ["server-core", "store-fjall"] }
```

Services typically re-export shared modules for internal use:

```rust
// In a service's acl.rs, auth.rs, store.rs, etc.
pub use affinidi_webvh_common::server::acl::*;
```

## Requirements

- Rust 1.94.0+ (2024 Edition)
