//! Agent name resolution — `GET /@{name}` (T-agent-names).
//!
//! An agent name is a human-memorable shortcut (`example.com/@alice`) that
//! **redirects** to a DID. This is the hosting side of the two-stage resolution
//! the agent-name specification describes: the name resolves to a DID here, and
//! a DID resolver turns that DID into a document.
//!
//! ## Why a route, not the 404 fallback
//!
//! Per-DID artifacts (`/{mnemonic}/did.jsonl`) are matched in the fallback
//! because axum's sibling catch-alls conflict at build time. Agent names are a
//! *prefix* match (`/@…`), which is a plain route with no such conflict — and
//! `@` is not a legal mnemonic character (`[a-z0-9-]` only), so `/@name` can
//! never shadow a hosted DID path.
//!
//! ## The redirect contract
//!
//! `302 Found` with `Location: <the DID>`. The agent-name FAQ leaves the status
//! code and target form unspecified; the companion `agent-names` resolver
//! accepts any 3xx carrying a bare `did:…` in `Location`, so this is the
//! concrete contract those two ends agree on.
//!
//! ## Trust
//!
//! A name only appears in the index if the signed DID document claimed it via
//! `alsoKnownAs` (see `control_register::apply_single_update`). This handler
//! therefore serves a redirect the document has already authorised; the
//! resolver still re-verifies `alsoKnownAs` itself, because this service is a
//! cache of that authorisation, not the authority for it.
