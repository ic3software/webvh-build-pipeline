# Affinidi WebVH Server

The WebVH Server is a read-only DID hosting edge node for
[WebVH](https://www.w3.org/TR/did-web-vh/) DIDs. It serves DID
documents publicly and receives sync updates from the
[control plane](../did-hosting-control/) via DIDComm through a mediator.

All DID lifecycle management (create, publish, delete) is handled
by the control plane. The server's role is to host and resolve
DIDs at its public URL. For a self-contained deployment, use the
[daemon](../did-hosting-daemon/) instead.

## Getting Started

This guide walks you through building the server, obtaining
credentials from your Affinidi Trust Context (VTA), and running
the interactive setup wizard.

### Prerequisites

- Rust 1.94.0+ (2024 Edition)
- A VTA credential (base64url string) for the server's VTA context

### 1. Clone and build

```bash
git clone https://github.com/affinidi/did-hosting-service.git
cd did-hosting-service
cargo build -p did-hosting-server --release
```

The binary is produced at `target/release/did-hosting-server`.

Alternatively, you can install the server directly with Cargo:

```bash
cargo install did-hosting-server
```

### 2. Run the setup wizard

```bash
did-hosting-server setup
```

For CI / scripted deployments, drop the wizard prompts and use a
declarative recipe:

```bash
# Online (after `setup --setup-key-out` enrolment of an ephemeral did:key):
did-hosting-server setup --from examples/did-hosting-server-build.toml \
                   --setup-key-file setup.key

# Air-gapped (both phases non-interactive):
did-hosting-server setup --from recipe.toml   # phase 1: writes bootstrap-request.json
# (operator ferries to VTA admin, gets sealed bundle back)
did-hosting-server setup --from recipe.toml   # phase 2 (vta_mode = "offline-complete"
                                        # + bundle_path + expect_digest set)
```

See [docs/bootstrap_startup.md](../docs/bootstrap_startup.md#non-interactive-setup-recipe-driven)
for the recipe schema, env-var overlay, exit codes, and reprovision
safety.

The wizard walks you through all required configuration:

- **VTA credential** — authenticates with the server's VTA
  context and creates the root DID automatically
- **Features** — enable DIDComm messaging and/or REST API
- **Public URL** — the externally reachable URL of this server
- **Control plane** — URL and DID of the did-hosting-control service
- **Host / port** — listen address (default: `0.0.0.0:8530`)
- **Log level / format** — logging configuration
- **Data directory** — persistent storage path
- **Secrets backend** — where to store private key material
  (OS keyring, AWS Secrets Manager, or GCP Secret Manager)
- **Admin bootstrap** — enter an existing DID or generate a
  new `did:key` identity

The wizard writes `config.toml` (without any key material) and
stores the server's private keys in the chosen secrets backend.

### 3. Start the server

```bash
did-hosting-server --config config.toml
```

On startup the server loads secrets from the configured backend.
If no secrets are found it exits with an error directing you to
run `did-hosting-server setup` first.

## Configuration

The server is configured via a TOML file. By default it looks
for `config.toml` in the current directory. You can specify a
different path with the `--config` flag or the
`DID_HOSTING_CONFIG_PATH` environment variable.

### Example `config.toml`

```toml
# Server DID identity (required for DIDComm auth)
server_did = "did:webvh:webvh.example.com"
mediator_did = "did:webvh:mediator.example.com"
public_url = "https://webvh.example.com"

[features]
didcomm = true
rest_api = true

[server]
host = "0.0.0.0"    # Bind address
port = 8530          # Bind port

[log]
level = "info"       # trace, debug, info, warn, error
format = "text"      # text or json

[store]
data_dir = "data/did-hosting-server"   # Persistent data directory (fjall)

[auth]
access_token_expiry = 900                   # 15 minutes
refresh_token_expiry = 86400                # 24 hours
challenge_ttl = 300                         # 5 minutes
session_cleanup_interval = 600              # 10 minutes
cleanup_ttl_minutes = 60                    # Empty DID cleanup (minutes)

[secrets]
keyring_service = "webvh"                   # OS keyring service name (default backend)
# aws_secret_name = "did-hosting-server-secrets"  # Use AWS Secrets Manager instead
# aws_region = "us-east-1"
# gcp_project = "my-project"               # Use GCP Secret Manager instead
# gcp_secret_name = "did-hosting-server-secrets"

[limits]
upload_body_limit = 102400                  # Max upload body size (bytes), default 100KB
default_max_total_size = 1048576            # Per-account total DID size (bytes), default 1MB
default_max_did_count = 20                  # Per-account max number of DIDs

# Optional: push DID updates to watcher instances
# [[watchers]]
# url = "http://watcher1.example.com:8533"
# token = "shared-secret-token"
```

Private keys (signing, key agreement, JWT signing) are **not**
stored in the config file. They are managed by the secrets
backend selected during `did-hosting-server setup`. See
[Secrets Backends](#secrets-backends) below.

#### Resource Limits

The `[limits]` section controls per-account resource quotas:

- **`upload_body_limit`** — Maximum request body size for
  `did.jsonl` and witness uploads. Requests exceeding this are
  rejected with `413 Payload Too Large`. Default: `102400`
  (100 KB).

- **`default_max_total_size`** — Default per-account total size
  across all DID documents. When an upload would push an
  account's combined DID content above this limit, the request
  is rejected. Default: `1048576` (1 MB).

- **`default_max_did_count`** — Default per-account maximum
  number of DIDs. Once reached, new DID creation requests are
  rejected. Default: `20`.

Admins are exempt from all quota checks. Per-account overrides
can be set via the ACL API by including `max_total_size` and/or
`max_did_count` in the ACL entry — these take precedence over
the global defaults.

#### Watcher Push

The optional `[[watchers]]` section configures DID replication
to [watcher](../webvh-watcher/) instances. When a DID is
published, updated, or deleted, the server pushes the change to
each registered watcher. Push failures are logged but do not
block the primary operation.

```toml
[[watchers]]
url = "http://watcher1.example.com:8533"
token = "shared-secret-token"

[[watchers]]
url = "http://watcher2.example.com:8533"
```

### Secrets Backends

Private key material is stored outside the config file in a
pluggable secrets backend. The backend is selected at compile
time via feature flags and at runtime via config/env vars.

| Backend              | Feature flag    | Config fields                                                                  |
| -------------------- | --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| OS Keyring (default) | `keyring`       | `secrets.keyring_service`                                                      |
| AWS Secrets Manager  | `aws-secrets`   | `secrets.aws_secret_name`, `secrets.aws_region`                                |
| GCP Secret Manager   | `gcp-secrets`   | `secrets.gcp_project`, `secrets.gcp_secret_name`                               |
| Azure Key Vault      | `azure-secrets` | `secrets.azure_vault_url`, `secrets.azure_secret_name`                         |
| Plaintext (testing)  | *(default)*     | `[secrets.plaintext]` — **do not use in production**, secrets land on disk    |

The server stores its key material as a JSON-serialized record
in the backend:

- **signing_key** — Ed25519 private key for server DID signing
- **key_agreement_key** — X25519 private key for DIDComm
  encryption
- **jwt_signing_key** — Ed25519 private key for JWT token
  signing
- **vta_credential** — VTA credential for re-authentication
  (optional)

Keys are stored in multibase format (Base58BTC with multicodec
type prefix), which is self-describing and can be directly
loaded as `Secret` objects.

To compile with a non-default backend:

```bash
# AWS Secrets Manager
cargo build -p did-hosting-server --release --features aws-secrets

# GCP Secret Manager
cargo build -p did-hosting-server --release --features gcp-secrets

# Multiple backends
cargo build -p did-hosting-server --release --features "keyring,aws-secrets"
```

### Storage Backends

The storage layer is pluggable — exactly one backend must be
selected at compile time via feature flags. The default backend
is **fjall**, an embedded key-value store that requires no
external services.

| Backend                   | Feature flag      | Config fields                                                                                                |
| ------------------------- | ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Fjall (default, embedded) | `store-fjall`     | `store.data_dir`                                                                                             |
| Redis                     | `store-redis`     | `store.redis_url`                                                                                            |
| AWS DynamoDB              | `store-dynamodb`  | `store.dynamodb_table`, `store.dynamodb_region`                                                              |
| Google Firestore          | `store-firestore` | `store.firestore_project`, `store.firestore_database`                                                        |
| Azure Cosmos DB           | `store-cosmosdb`  | `store.cosmosdb_endpoint`, `store.cosmosdb_database`, `store.cosmosdb_container`, `store.cosmosdb_region`    |

To build with a non-default storage backend:

```bash
cargo build -p did-hosting-server --release \
  --no-default-features --features "keyring,store-redis"
```

> **Note:** Enabling more than one `store-*` feature or zero
> `store-*` features will produce a compile error (enforced by
> `did-hosting-server/build.rs`).

### Environment Variable Overrides

Every config field can be overridden via environment variables
with the `DID_HOSTING_` prefix:

| Variable                              | Description                        |

## Building

### Default (with OS keyring)

```bash
cargo build -p did-hosting-server --release
```

This builds with the `keyring` and `store-fjall` features
enabled by default.

## CLI Commands

```
did-hosting-server                      # Run server (default)
did-hosting-server setup                # Interactive config wizard
did-hosting-server setup --from <recipe.toml>  # Non-interactive — see below
did-hosting-server uninstall            # Teardown: clear secrets + remove config
did-hosting-server health               # Run health check diagnostics
did-hosting-server add-acl              # Add ACL entry
did-hosting-server list-acl             # List ACL entries
did-hosting-server remove-acl           # Remove ACL entry
did-hosting-server list-dids            # List all DIDs in the store
did-hosting-server remove-did           # Remove a DID from the store
did-hosting-server dump-did             # Dump DID log for a path
did-hosting-server load-did             # Load a DID at an arbitrary path
did-hosting-server bootstrap-did        # Bootstrap a DID (defaults to .well-known)
did-hosting-server recreate-did         # Recreate a DID at a given path
did-hosting-server recover-did          # Recover a soft-deleted DID
did-hosting-server import-secrets       # Import secrets from VTA bundle or keys
did-hosting-server backup               # Export data to backup file
did-hosting-server restore              # Restore data from backup file
```

### Access Control

The `add-acl` command creates ACL entries directly from the
command line, without needing a running server or authenticated
API call. Useful for bootstrapping the first admin account.

```bash
# Add an admin
did-hosting-server add-acl --did did:key:z6Mk... --role admin

# Add an owner (default role)
did-hosting-server add-acl --did did:key:z6Mk...

# Add an owner with per-account quota overrides
did-hosting-server add-acl --did did:key:z6Mk... --max-total-size 2097152 --max-did-count 50

# With a specific config file
did-hosting-server --config /path/to/config.toml add-acl --did did:key:z6Mk... --role admin
```

The command will refuse to overwrite an existing entry — delete
it via the API first if you need to change a role.

### Listing ACL entries

```bash
did-hosting-server list-acl
```

### Backup & Restore

```bash
# Backup to default file (webvh-backup.json)
did-hosting-server backup

# Backup to a specific file
did-hosting-server backup --output /path/to/backup.json

# Restore data and config.toml
did-hosting-server restore --input /path/to/backup.json
```

The backup file is a single JSON document containing:

- **config** — the effective server configuration at backup time
- **dids** — all DID documents and logs
- **acl** — access control entries
- **stats** — DID resolution statistics

Ephemeral data (active sessions, refresh tokens, auth
challenges) is excluded. All keys and values are base64url
encoded.

## API Endpoints

All API endpoints are under the `/api` prefix.

## Performance Testing

The `perf_test` example is an interactive TUI benchmarking tool
for load-testing a running WebVH server. It sends concurrent DID
resolution requests and displays real-time metrics including
throughput, latency percentiles, network bandwidth, active
workers, and error rates.

### Building

```bash
cargo build --example perf_test -p did-hosting-server
```

### Usage

```bash
cargo run --example perf_test -p did-hosting-server -- [OPTIONS]
```

The tool supports two modes: **server mode** (default) authenticates
with a WebVH server and discovers DIDs automatically, while
**file mode** (`--did-file`) reads `did:webvh:...` identifiers from
a file and works against any hosted WebVH DID without needing
ACL access.

### Options

| Flag | Short | Default | Description |
| ---- | ----- | ------- | ----------- |
| `--server-url` | `-s` | `http://localhost:8530` | WebVH server URL |
| `--rate` | `-r` | `10` | Target requests per second (adjustable at runtime) |
| `--workers` | `-w` | `64` | Maximum concurrent in-flight requests |
| `--timeout` | `-t` | `5` | Request timeout in seconds |
| `--create-dids` | | `0` | Number of random DIDs to create on startup |
| `--create-parallel` | | `4` | Parallel concurrency for DID creation |
| `--seed` | | random | Ed25519 seed as 64 hex characters |
| `--did-file` | `-f` | | File of `did:webvh:...` identifiers (skips auth) |

### Keyboard Controls

| Key | Action |
| --- | ------ |
| `q` / `Esc` | Quit |
| `+` / `=` / `Up` | Increase target rate by 10 req/s |
| `-` / `Down` | Decrease target rate by 10 req/s |
| `]` | Double target rate |
| `[` | Halve target rate |

## Library Usage

The did-hosting-server crate can be used as a library (e.g., by the
[did-hosting-daemon](../did-hosting-daemon/)). It exposes:

- `did_hosting_server::config::AppConfig` — configuration
- `did_hosting_server::server::AppState` — application state
- `did_hosting_server::routes::router()` — Axum router
- `did_hosting_server::server::run()` — standalone entry point
